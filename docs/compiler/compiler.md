> Compiler as static analyzer / linter

> Compiler as language Server (LSP)

> Compiler as Assembler (byte-code?)

> Compiler as linker (late optimizations)

> Compiler as REPL (because we support Meta)

> Compiler as Language VM? (used by REPL) - zs-script

> Compiler as profiler?

> Compiler as build-system? Use REPL/VM to execute zs-script using build-task lib...?

> Semantic rules as functions available to code (traits?).

> Literal strings can add up. How to optimize? (interning?, string-builder for efficient construction?)
