# Structures

Structures are data records of fields.

A name and a set of fields is required in order to define a structure.

```
MyStruct
    field1: U8
    field2: Str
```

Note that the name of the structure has to start with a capital letter, because it is a new type.

Also note the absense of any specific keywords like 'struct'.
