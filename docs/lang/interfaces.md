# Interfaces

Interfaces are the means to polymorphism.

only functions.

Function interfaces - a template for a singe function. Usually used as a callback or delegate. When used compatibility of candidate function is determined by type comparison. The function name is irrelevant.

Object interfaces - a template for one or more functions. Usually used as a means to polymorphism.

Function interfaces are syntactically different from Object interfaces - so an object interface with one function cannot be mixed up/interchanged with a function interface.
