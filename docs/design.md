# Design Philosophy

Modern Language features (Range).
Strong Typed - but easy syntax.
But nothing radically new. Should look familiar.

No hidden memory allocation.
No hidden function calls.
Syntax directs thought. The way you write it down should match with the underlying model.

Simple to learn.
Minimal number of keywords.
Singular meaning (as much as possible) / one way to do things.

Easy to build (parse).

Translates well to 8-bit CPUs like Z80.

Explain: size, length, count, capacity.
