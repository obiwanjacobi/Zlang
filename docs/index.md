# Z\#

Z# (Zee-Sharp) is a simple language with modern features for restricted instruction sets, like the old 8-bit CPUs -like the Z80-  or small micro controllers.

## Work In Progress

I am still playing with the syntax, concepts and constructs of the language. Things will change!
Several pages have half finished notes on them. I write these down in a super short format to serve a reminder for me.
I am slowly transferring the notes I had written down in a private document, into this documentation - given me a chance to reconsider and make sure things stay as consistent as possible.

## TODO

- Optionals: how to test for existence of a value? (Pattern) Matching? Don't want to use a `switch`.
- Compile-time contracts: allow rules to be specified to check input and output of a function.
- FSM syntax?
